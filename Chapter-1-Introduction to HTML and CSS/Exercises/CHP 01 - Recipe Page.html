            <h2> Instructions </h2>

            <ol>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the chilled all-purpose cream and sweetened condensed milk. Mix until well combined and smooth. This will be your cream mixture.</li>
                <li>Prepare a rectangular or square dish that will fit the layers of graham crackers and cream mixture. You can also use individual serving glasses for a more elegant presentation.</li>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of the cream mixture at the bottom of the dish.</li>
                <li>Arrange a layer of graham crackers on top of the cream mixture, covering the entire bottom of the dish.</li>
                <li>Add another layer of the cream mixture on top of the graham crackers, spreading it evenly.</li>
                <li>Arrange a layer of sliced mangoes on top of the cream mixture, covering it completely.</li>
                <li>Repeat the layers until you reach the desired height or use up all the ingredients, ending with a layer of cream mixture on top.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle crushed graham crackers on top for added texture and garnish with mango chunks if desired.</li>
                <li>Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight to allow the flavors to meld and the dessert to set.</li>
                <li>Once chilled and set, slice into squares or scoop into individual serving glasses.</li>
            </ol>
