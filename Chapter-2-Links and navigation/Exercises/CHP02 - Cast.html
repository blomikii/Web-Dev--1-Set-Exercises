                    <h1>02. Calum <i>(Paul Mescal)</i></h1>
                    <p>Calum grapples with the weight of life outside of fatherhood while creating cherished memories with Sophie. Calum’s love for his daughter speaks volumes about him, even though his fate is marked by tragedy. The film subtly implies that he either commits suicide or faces a heartbreaking end due to self-destructive behavior or mental health issues.</p>
